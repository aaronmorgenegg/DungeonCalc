/*
Dungeons and Dragons calculator, useful for a few things when DMing.
Version 2.0
Written by Aaron Morgenegg

Version 2.0 - Rewrote entire program, 
Version 1.0.1 - 8/25/2016 - Added note feature for units in the initiative tracker
Version 1.0 - 8/13/2016 - Original Release

Program Functions:
Has basic functionality like a help menu and quit.
Has a very basic 4 function calculator, can calculate a single operation per line
When given a number, generates a random number from 1 to that number.
If given a dice roll, rolls that dice. ie 2d8+2.
Can keep track of initiative, and can keep notes for each character

Ideas for future versions:
Allow for saving/loading of initiative list
Further foolproof the input so the program doesn't outright crash because of user error
Add a counter for each unit, that can be set at an initial value, and then counts down every time it is their turn again. Also make a message appear each time it counts down, or a custom message when it ends.
